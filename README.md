# Introduction to Trial Design

An AAGI [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) slide deck built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) that covers basic trial protocols and data collection best practices for industry partners.

## Viewing and Presenting the Slides

### HTML Interactive Slide Show

Go [here](https://aagi-aus.github.io/Trial_Protocol_Best_Practices/trial_protocols_and_best_data_practices.html#/title-slide) and hit "s" for a separate window that will have the speaker notes so you can see what each slide covers in more detail.
Hit "f" on the main screen for a full-screen or select from the hamburger menu icon in the lower left corner of your screen.

### PDF of the Slides

A [PDF](GGA_training_session_3_trial_design.pdf) file version of the slides is also available.

## Modifying and Building the Slides

You will need [Quarto](https://quarto.org) installed locally to rebuild the slide deck but not to view or present the HTML slide deck.

Then, the `aagi_cu_trial_design.qmd` can be knit to create `aagi_cu_trial_design.html`.

## Modifying and Building the Website

To update the website, use `quarto publish gh-pages` in the root directory of this repository.
